# 03 Introduction to Geometric Deep Learning
This repository tracks the content covered in Project 03 - Introduction to Geometric Deep Learning offered by the Stamatics Society, IITK in Summer '23.

Large parts of the course content were taken from the [PyG Docs](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/colabs.html), and the Stanford Course [Machine Learning with Graphs](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/index.html#schedule) and we are grateful to them for keeping their content free and open-source.
